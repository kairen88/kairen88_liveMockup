<h1>jhid-1.0.0</h1>
<br>
Project homepage: <a href="http://jhid.sourceforge.net">http://jhid.sourceforge.net</a><br>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This library provides a Java API to access Human Interaction Devices in
a platform independant way.<br>
Although the API is platform independant, it currently only has a linux
implementation; contributions to provide implementations on other
platforms are welcome.<br>
<h2>Building<br>
</h2>
There is an ant buildfile in the root of the distribution. The default
target will build everything. You will have jhid.jar and the native
libraries in the build directory, and the javadoc in the doc directory.<br>
<h2>Running</h2>
The JVM must be able to access jhid native libraries. There are several
ways to achieve that.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Add the following VM option:</li>
</ul>
<pre>-Djava.library.path=&lt;path&gt;<br></pre>
Where &lt;path&gt; is the directory that contains the native libraries.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Add the path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing</h2>
To test if jhid is working on your system, you can run the following
command in the root directory of the distribution (provided you
performed the build):<br>
<pre># java -Djava.library.path=build -cp build/jhid.jar net.jhid.test.Test<br></pre>
This test first prints a list of all the devices found by jhid, and
then prints all the events received by all these devices, until you
interrupt it
by Ctrl+C.<br>
<h2>Using in Linux</h2>
In linux the jhid API is implemented using the devices
/dev/input/event* or /dev/input/evedv*.<br>
The user must have access to the files
in the /dev/input virtual directory.<br>
On Mandrake 10, run the following command as root:<br>
<pre># chmod 777 -R /dev/input<br></pre>
[Instructions on how to do this with other distributions are welcome]<br>
