Quote from ICon's website:<br>
<cite>IC<small>ON</small> (Input Configurator) is a novel system for
making
input-reconfigurable interactive applications, based on cascading
reactive devices. It allows programmers to test and validate a large
number of dedicated input methods. It also allows power users to
customize those methods to suit their needs. Many application domains
would strongly benefit from relying on such a system, including 3D
authoring, virtual reality, computer games, accessibility for disabled
users, wearable and mobile computing, and embedded systems.</cite><br>
